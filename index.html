	  The purpose of this website is to provide a calculator for shed parts to help with cost of materials estimates, and to provide useful links for shed building and the purchase of materials.<br>  
		  Please enjoy the links while this website is being developed.  Also enjoy these gravel and cement foundation calculators.<br>

This calculator helps estimate the cubic yards of gravel needed to build a 4 to 6 inch gravel foundation for varying sizes of sheds.<br>

Enter length in feet <br>
Enter width in feet<br>
Enter depth in inches<br>


This calculator helps estimate the number of bags of cement needed to build a 4 to 6 inch cement foundation for varying sizes of sheds.<br>
